# Forest_fire_analysis
The analysis seeks to understand when forest fires occur and what causes them which are important aspects of managing them,
since they can create ecological problems and endanger human lives and property.

The data we'll be working with in this guided project is associated with a scientific research paper on predicting the occurrence of forest fires in Portugal using modeling techniques. We will not use any type of modeling on this project, but rather we'll focus on visualizing it.
Kindly refer to the notepad for more information.
